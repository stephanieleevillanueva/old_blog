No... we're not talking about the hot, succulent liquid dish you indulge in at restaurants or those packaged goods you get from 
groceries, though it would be quite tempting to blog about where to get the best chowders or pumpkin soup in the country. I guess I will just have to save it for another day.

If you are a new Python programmer like me, chances are you'd run into this thing called ``BeautifulSoup`` when you get to do web scraping. I have tried looking into the origin of its name but no luck so far in my search so for now, we'll focus on what
``BeautifulSoup`` is and what it does.

``BeautifulSoup`` is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees and does the tree traversal for you as well. It helps users extract data from HTML quickly using various built-in methods. In short, it is a very handy tool for doing fast and efficient webscraping.
