title: "Week 1: A Very Simple Study On NYC Subway Data"
published: true

I'll be real honest and say this is my first ever attempt at blogging... so if at any point you start to scratch your head and wonder how reading this will add value to your life (it won't, really haha) or worse, I start to bore you to death, you have my permission to move on to the next funner and more interesting blogger out there. :D

So it's my 1st week out of a gruesome (my personal opinion) and insanely intense 12-week program at Metis Data Science Bootcamp here in New York and I thought of writing about our 1st ever project as well as the challenges that came along with it. I'll make this as short and painless as possible, I promise!

We were asked to come up with a simple analysis on NYC's subway data being that well, this is New York and I'd say about 95% of people here take the subway to wherever and it would be a bit interesting to check out some stats about subway ridership.

Btw, a shout out to my groupmates Nidhin and Julia for making this project a success!

After a good number of brainstorming sessions our group came to an agreement that we will do a study on the busiest MTA stations with also the highest ratio of commuters based on data we gathered from http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html (MTA ridership) and http://web.mta.info/developers/fare.html (MTA fare). Why choose this particular dataset you might ask? The answer is... actually for no particular reason lol. Though knowing where to best reach actual "New Yorkers" and not the tourists may come in handy later.

Now on to the process...

Having learned Python in the past week we put it to good use during this project. First, we needed to import the necessary Python modules (see below).
