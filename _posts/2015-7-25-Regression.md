It has been more than a decade since I last encountered statistical regression so it was not suprising that I had completely 
forgotten about what it is and what it does. For a non-math major like myself, regression would most likely mean to return to 
a former or less developed state. It sort of gives that negative connotation of moving backwards or not progressing. So imagine 
my confusion when I learned that we will be applying regression in statistical modeling. I was like... "wait, what?" 

Anyway, enough about that. I am writing this blog as it is my duty to try to help out ordinary (no offense to math and statistics 
folks, you are all brilliant!) "regressors" (like me :)) understand this concept in the most basic and non-technical manner.

Is it normal to wonder how "regression" became a very popular term in statistics and the answer to that is Francis Galton. I'm not
going to dive deep into his research because that will need an entirely new blog, but the long and short of it, "regression" was
derived from Galton's 1886 paper titled "Regression towards mediocrity in hereditary stature". If you are curious to know more
about his research, here is a good resource:
